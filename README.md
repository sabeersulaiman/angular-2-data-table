## Ngx Simple Data Table

A simple Angular 4.x data table, with built-in solutions for features including:

* pagination
* sorting
* row selection (single/multi)
* expandable rows
* column resizing
* selecting visible columns
* Filtering Columns

Any PR for improving the compatibility an functionality are welcome. I am planning a rewrite, as this is a quick beat up for my needs. All credits for the current code goes to ggmod's [angular 2 data table](https://github.com/ggmod/angular-2-data-table).

The component can be used not just with local data, but remote resources too: for example if the sorting and paging happen in the database.

The templates use bootstrap CSS class names, so the component requires a bootstrap .css file to be present in the application using it.

Check out the [demo code](https://github.com/sabeersulaiman/ngx-simple-datatable-demo) for examples on how to use it. 

## Installing:
